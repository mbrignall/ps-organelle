~Work in Progress~

I absolutely love the Organelle from Critter and Guitari!

It has become an essential tool in my creative process, helping me generate musical ideas, experiment with effects, and explore Pure Data. The best part is the community they've built around their instruments, which keeps the inspiration flowing. You can learn more about it [[https://www.critterandguitari.com/organelle][here]].

[[https://patchstorage.com/][Patchstorage]] is an excellent community driven platform of Audio and Visual programming enthusiasts and it turns out they have a neat [[https://github.com/patchstorage/patchstorage-docs/wiki][API]]!

This project provides a Python script that downloads patches for the *Organelle* platform from Patchstorage and organizes them into folders based on their categories for example:

- Synthesizers
- Effects
- etc.

Each patch entry includes the title, author, URL, description excerpt, and tags, with the tags neatly aligned to the right for easy readability in Emacs.

** Features
- Fetches patches for the Organelle platform from Patchstorage.
- Generates an Org-mode file with basic patch information (title, author, description excerpt, URL, tags).
- Tags are right-aligned for improved readability in Emacs.

** Requirements
- A Patchstorage API token (stored securely in an environment variable).
- Python 3.x
- ~requests~ library
- ~python-dotenv~ library

** Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   #+begin_src bash
     git clone https://github.com/mbrignall/ps-organelle.git
     cd ps-organelle
     poetry install
   #+end_src

2. Set up your Patchstorage API token by adding it to a `.env` file in the project root:
   
   ~PATCHSTORAGE_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here~
   
** Usage

The main script, =ps-organelle.py=, is used to fetch patches for the Organelle platform from Patchstorage.

- To fetch patches, run the following command which puts them in ~patches~ folder:

  ~poetry run python ps-organelle.py~

- Then to generate the org file:

  ~poetry run python export-to-org.py~

- The script will generate a file called =patches.org= in the project directory.

- Open the =patches.org= file in Emacs to browse the patch information.

** Example Output

Here is an example of the output in the =patches.org= file:
